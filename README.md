## General Information
- 
-  A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

- Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.


## Conclusions
**The optimal value of lambda for ridge is 7.5 and lasso regression is 0.5**

**On building and comparing few models**

- we found the variables that are significant in increasing the price of a house are YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, GarageArea, GrLivArea, and ScreenPorch. 

- While the we found the variables that are significant in decreasing the price of a house are Heating, HeatingQC, BsmtUnfSF, MSSubClass, and PoolArea 

- So, these guides shall be considered while buying a house in low price and selling them at a higher price
